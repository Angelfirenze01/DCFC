God bless the daylight, the sugary smell of springtime//Remembering when you were mine in a still suburban town // When every Thursday I'd brave those mountain passes and you'd skip you're early classes and we'd learn how our bodies worked...God damn the black night with all of its foul temptation // I become what I always hated, when I was with you then...//We looked like giants in the back of my gray subcompact...//Fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside...//And together there, in a shroud of frost, the mountain air began to pass through every pane of weathered glass...//And I held you closer than anyone would ever get...//Do you remember the JAMC? And reading aloud from magazines? //  I don't know about you, but I swear on my name, they could smell it on me...I've never been good secrets.  No...//...And together there, in a shroud of frost and mountain air, began to pass through every pane of weathered glass...And I held you closer...
