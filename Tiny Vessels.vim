This is the moment that you know that you told her that you loved her, but you don't//Touch her skin and then you think that she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me//Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me...//

I wanted to believe in every word that I was speaking as we moved together in the dark//And all the words that I was saying, all the perfect misspellings and every bite I gave you left a mark//When tiny vessels oozed into your neck and formed the bruises that you said you didn't want to fade//But they did and so did I that day...//

All I see are dark grey clouds, in the distance moving closer with every hour//So when you ask is something wrong, I think 'You're damned right there is, but we can't talk about it now...No we can't talk about now...'//

So one last touch and then we'll go and we'll pretend that it was something so much more...But it was vile and it was cheap and you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me//No, you don't mean a thing to me...
